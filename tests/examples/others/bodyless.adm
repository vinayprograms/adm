Model: A sample model to analyze authentication options

    As an attacker
    I want to compromize authentication
    So that I can masquerade as a legit user

    As a defender
    I want to secure authentication options
    So that attacker cannot steal credentials
    And masquerade as legit user

    
    Attack: Default password
        Given target's default passwords are publicly known
        When target uses default passwords
        Then default passwords can be used to gain control of the target
    @password
    Attack: Commonly used password
    @password
    Attack: Password leak via rainbow tables
    @password
    Attack: Brute-force password guessing
    @password
    Attack: Reverse-hashing of password

    Policy: Minimum Password Requirements
        Assumption: Password is required for login
            Given system uses passwords for login
            And system is unable to use any other authentication method
        Defense: Password must be at least 8 characters long
        Defense: Passwords must be changed upon first login
            When target uses default passwords
            And user logs in for the first time
            Then user must be asked to change the password
        Defense: Passwords must not contain common dictionary words
        Defense: Passwords must not be reused across multiple systems
        Defense: Passwords must not be stored using weak hashing algorithms
        Defense: Passwords must be salted before storing

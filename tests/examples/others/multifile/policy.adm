Model: Password security policy
    As an attacker
    I want to exploit password authentication
    So that I can masquerade as a legit user

    As a defender
    I want to ensure passwords are secure
    So that attacker cannot steal credentials
    And masquerade as legit user

    Policy: Minimum Password Requirements
        Assumption: Password is required for login
          Given system uses passwords for login
          And system is unable to use any other authentication method
        Defense: Password must be at least 8 characters long
          When A new password is set
          And password length is less than 8 characters
          Then Notify security team about password length issue
        Defense: Passwords must be changed upon first login
          When target uses default passwords
          And user logs in for the first time
          Then user must be asked to change the password
        Defense: Passwords must not contain common dictionary words
          When A new password is set
          And password or its substrings contain words from dictionary
          Then Notify security team about password length issue
        Defense: Passwords must not be reused across multiple systems
          Given integration with other systems' authentication services
          When A new password is set
          And a check with other systems detects that same password is used
          Then Notify security team about password length issue
        Defense: Passwords must not be stored using weak hashing algorithms
        Defense: Passwords must be salted before storing

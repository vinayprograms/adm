Model: Security of refresh tokens
 	As an attacker
 	I want to steal refresh tokens
 	So that I can request new access tokens

	As a defender
 	I want to secure refresh tokens
 	So that attacker cannot obtain access tokens

	# Attack a client and copy refresh tokens
	# Attack authorization server and obtain refresh tokens

	Defense: Refresh token security on web-servers

	Defense: Authenticate client
	 	When a refresh token is sent from client
 		Then authenticate the client
 		And identify that client in the list of registered clients

Model: End-user phishing
	As an attacker
 	I want to phish end-user passwords
 	So that I can use them to gain access to user resources
	As a defender
 	I want to control the impact phishing attacks have
 	So that attacker cannot access user resources

	@external-content
	Attack: Embed web UI component
	 	When authentication page is sent to the client
 		Then inject attacker script that presents attacker's UI instead of original UI
 		And phish user credentials
	@external-content
	Defense: Never load contents from external sources in authentication page

	@phishing
	Attack: End user email phishing
	 	When a phishing email is sent
 		Then end-user opens the email
	 	And clicks on the login link
	 	And povides credentials on the malicious site
	@phishing
	Defense: Client should never ask for credentials
	 	When a client presents authentication page instead of redirecting to OAuth server
 		Then don't enter credentials
	@phishing
	Defense: Verify sender's email
		When email asking to login again is received
		Then verify if sender's email is from the right domain address

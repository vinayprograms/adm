Feature: User redirection to malicious domains
  As a attacker
  I want to redirect users to a domain under my control
  So that I can steal authorization code from users during the redirection step of OAuth
  @redirection-uri
  Scenario: Partial URIs are considered valid
    Given a registered redirection URI
    When part of that URI is presented during redirection
    Then requests are redirected to attacker's domain

Model: Extract access tokens
 	As an attacker
 	I want to extract access tokens
 	So that I can masquerade as the original client

	As a defender
 	I want to secure access tokens
 	So that attacker cannot extract access tokens

	@token-store
	Attack: Compromize token storage
	@token-store
	Defense: Keep tokens only in transient memory
	@token-store
	Defense: Keep tokens only in private memory
	@token-store
	Defense: Apply same level of protection as refresh tokens to access tokens

	@wide-scope-token
	Attack: Exploit token with wider scope
		Given a leaked access token
		When access token is submitted
		Then access with wider scope is obtained

	@wide-scope-token
	Defense: limit token scope
 		When a token is issued to a client
 		Then its access scope is limited to the minimum required rights for that client
	@wide-scope-token
	Defense: Configure token to expire after fixed period of no-use
	 	When a token is issued to a client
 		And if client hasn't used it for a predefined period
 		Then revoke that token
	@wide-scope-token
	Defense: Limit token lifetime
	 	When a token is issued to a client
 		Then restrict its lifetime to a fix number of max. uses
	 	And limit max. use count to a sensible number.
	@wide-scope-token
	Defense: Don't issue token-clones
	 	Given a token with specific rights is issued to a client
 		When that client requests a new token with same rights
	 	Then invalidate previous token
	 	And issue a new token

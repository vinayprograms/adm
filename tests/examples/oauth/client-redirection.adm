Model: User redirection to malicious domains
 	As an attacker
 	I want to redirect users to a domain under my control
 	So that I can steal authorization code from users during the redirection step of OAuth
 	As a defender
 	I want to restrict redirection only to approved list of domains
 	So that the attacker cannot redirect users to a domain their control

	@redirection-uri
	Attack: Partial URIs are considered valid
	 	Given a registered redirection URI
 		When part of that URI is presented during redirection
 		Then requests are redirected to attacker's domain
	@redirection-uri
	Defense: Require clients to register full redirection URI and partial versions of these URIs must trigger a error response.
